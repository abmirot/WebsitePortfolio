        <h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>Hi! I’m Abigail Mirot, a current Junior at the University of Pittsburgh. 
            I’m double majoring in English Literature and Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (DNID). DNID involves a mixture of design and Information Science courses. 
            After I graduate I hope to earn my master’s in Library and Information Science and become a children’s librarian. 
            Books and stories have been my longest passion. I'm originally from western Massachusetts but a large reason 
            I came to Pitt was because of its fantastic English program.</p>
            <p> I want to become a librarian, specifically, because I believe that libraries are some of the last free spaces 
                left in the world. At the library, everyone is equal and has access to the same educational and creative opportunities. 
                People can form communities and bond without any pressure to spend money. I hope to contribute to those spaces in my career and help to move 
                them further into the technological age.</p>
            <p>
                I believe one of the best ways to make literature accessible to everyone is through technology. 
                With BookTok and e-readers, there has been an unprecedented resurgence of reading as a hobby. 
                If people in the literary community are technologically skilled then there is no limit to the amount of people books can reach. 
                That’s why I’ve spent so much of my time in college trying to improve my tech skills through computer programming classes, 
                an internship at WPTS Radio, and as an Audio/Visual Technician for William Pitt Union.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for extracurriculars, I’m currently the Business Manager for the on-campus literary magazine 
                Cherry Bomb and I'm involved in Sigma Tau Delta (the English Honors Society). Last year I was also a part of  
                the organizing committee for the 2024 Undergraduate Literature Conference. In my free time, I enjoy reading, 
                making lists, watching my favorite shows (Superstore, The Last of Us, The Good Place), and hanging out with friends.
            </p>
